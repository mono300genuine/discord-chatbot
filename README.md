## Notes

- ChatGPT is the fastest model that you can use.
- Integrated drawing is not available for GPT4All.
- Please do not enter any personal information in the Chatbot or in the image generators,
because your prompts are sent to various providers.
- When you use Stable Horde to generate images, your prompts are sent to Stable Horde, as listed in their [privacy policy](https://stablehorde.net/privacy). 
- The chatbot may not work as expected if multiple users are chatting with it at once. 
- When using Replit, GPT4All cannot be used.
- When using Replit, you must input your .env variables in the `Secrets` button on Replit.

## Generate images faster with Stable Horde
Stable Horde uses Kudos to rank users on a queue. The more Kudos you have, the higher you are on the generation queue.
You get Kudos by rating images and/or generating images for Stable Horde
on your local hardware.
To get more Kudos, first stick your api key [here](https://tinybots.net/artbot/settings).
Then, rate some images generated by other users [here](https://tinybots.net/artbot/rate).
After rating for a few minutes, you will have more Kudos!
**IMPORTANT: When an image says, "This rating must be x," you must rate it that. This picture is used as a Captcha to avoid spam.**
