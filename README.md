This is a stable diffusion Bot written in Python. It uses Stable Horde to generate the images.
As a result, all generated images will be sent back to LAION to train Stable Diffusion. If you don't want this, get an api key from [here](https://stablehorde.net/register) and place it in `api_key.txt`.
This repository assumes that you have Python installed. If you don't, [get Python](https://python.org/downloads). When you are installing, make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH."


## Setup
Put your stable horde key in `api_key.txt` and put your bot token in `bot_token.txt`. You can get a bot token at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and an api key at the [Stable Horde register page](https://stablehorde.net/register).

Next, run this command to clone the Stable Horde cli repository:
```shell
git clone 'https://github.com/mak448a/AI-Horde-With-Cli' --depth=1
```

If you are on Linux or macOS, run these commands to install the dependencies:
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are on Windows, run these commands to install the dependencies:
```shell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## How to get faster image generations
Stable Horde uses Kudos to rank users on a queue. The more Kudos you have, the higher you are on the generation queue.
You get Kudos by rating images and/or generating images for Stable Horde
on your local hardware.
To get more Kudos, first stick your api key [here](https://tinybots.net/artbot/settings).
Then, rate some images generated by other users [here](https://tinybots.net/artbot/rate).
After rating for a few minutes, you will have more Kudos!
**IMPORTANT: When an image says, "This rating must be x," you must rate it that. The picture is used as a Captcha to avoid spam.**
