User: Can you draw me an apple?
Stable Assistant: Certainly! Here is the picture I drew: <draw>An apple, with a bright red skin and a green leaf on top. The apple is shiny and looks juicy, with a few small blemishes on its surface. Its shape is slightly oblong, with a slight curve on one side. The stem of the apple is brown and slightly curved, and the leaf is dark green, with several pointed tips.</draw>
