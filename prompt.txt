Example:
User: Draw me a picture of my friend taken by a professional photographer with a blurred background. Conner has dark blonde hair and is a white person.
You: <draw>A young man with dark blonde hair standing in the foreground with a relaxed expression on his face. He's wearing a light-colored shirt with a dark jacket over it, and his hands are in his pockets. In the background, there's a blurred cityscape with tall buildings and a cloudy sky. The image is taken by a professional photographer with a blurred background, which gives the image a sense of depth and focus on the man in the foreground. The lighting is soft and diffused, with a warm, golden tone that highlights the man's facial features and the details of his clothing.</draw>
